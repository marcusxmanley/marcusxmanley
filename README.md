# Marcus Manley, Berlin

I'm Marcus Manley, currently studying on my own (with a little help from my friends) to become a professional programmer.

At the moment I'm doing really basic stuff, mostly in C and Python.

My main goals in learning programming are to contribute to free software, and to initiate a couple of free software projects of my own in areas I'm interested in:

* Health
* Astrology
* Self-organization and group-organization
* Knowledge management
* Writing

Further down the line I'd consider employment in software development if there were a truly interesting job opportunity.

## Life before code

* Born in 1978
* I currently work full-time as a self-employed spiritual consultant in the Western Spiritual Tradition
* Intensive Care and Anaesthesiology Nurse Specialist, worked in health care as an ICU RN for more than two decades
* Family in Europe and America, dual EU and US citizen
* Grew up in Frankfurt am Main, moved to Berlin in my 30s, found my wonderful husband and many interesting things in this wonderful and interesting city
