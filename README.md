# Marcus Manley, Berlin

I'm Marcus Manley, currently studying on my own (with a little help from my friends) to become a professional programmer.

At the moment I'm doing really basic stuff, mainly in C and Python.

My main goals in learning programming are to contribute to free software, and to initiate a couple of free software projects of my own in areas I'm interested in: health, astrology, self-organization and group-organization, knowledge management.

Further down the line I'd consider employment in software development if there were a truly interesting job opportunity.
