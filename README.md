# Marcus Manley, Berlin

I'm Marcus Manley, a programming student from Berlin. I'm `mmanley-` at _42_.

For questions, comments, or chit-chat write to [marcusxmanley@gmail.com](mailto:marcusxmanley@gmail.com).

## Learning to program

I'm studying programming at [_42_ Berlin](https://42berlin.de). I'm doing the _Common Core_ basic studies, from 2022 to 2024.

I started coding in August 2022 with the [_42_ piscine](https://42berlin.de/the-piscine-at-42/), so I'm doing the typical beginner's curriculum:

* C
* Unix
* Robozzle

## Life before code

Born in 1978, family in Europe and America, grew up in Frankfurt am Main, moved to Berlin in my late 30s, found my wonderful husband and many interesting things in this wonderful and interesting city.

In my previous profession I was an intensive care nurse specialist for two decades.

Currently I work full-time as a spiritual consultant. I won't link my business here as I like to separate my spiritual and technical interests.

## Life after school

In the future I'd like to become a professional software developer.

I'm still very open about my career. I would perhaps like to work for the health care industry. I have also worked as a temp worker (travelling nurse in intensive care) and have many ideas for this business.

Some of my personal interests also offer great opportunities for software, especially astrology and other forms of divination.
