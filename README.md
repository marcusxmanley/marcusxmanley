# Marcus Manley, Berlin

I'm Marcus Manley from Berlin. I'm `mmanley-` at _42_.

For questions, comments, or chit-chat write to [marcusxmanley@gmail.com](mailto:marcusxmanley@gmail.com).

## Learning to program

I will start studying coding at [_42_ Berlin](https://42berlin.de) in December 2022. The core curriculum will take about a year.

I started coding in August 2022, so I'm a total beginner.

I am doing the typical _42_ beginner's curriculum: mainly C and Unix.

While waiting for school to start I am working through [Stephen G. Kochan's _Programming in C_ tutorial](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-in-c/9780132781206/).

Through building several websites I have rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, and Wordpress.

## 42 projects

As school hasn't started yet, I have only begun a single project of the core curriculum (which we were advised to do to while away the weeks until November 28):

* [`libft`: Re-coding useful C functions](https://github.com/marcusxmanley/libft)

## Things I like

One of the things I hope to be able to do soon is to contribute to some projects:

* [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
* [Neo keyboard layout](https://neo-layout.org)
* [Amphetype](https://gitlab.com/franksh/amphetype)

## Life before code

Born in 1978, family in Europe and America, grew up in Frankfurt am Main, moved to Berlin in my late 30s, found my wonderful husband and many interesting things in this wonderful and interesting city.

In my previous profession I was an intensive care nurse specialist for two decades.

Currently I work full-time as a spiritual consultant. I won't link my business here as I like to separate my spiritual and technical interests.

## Life after school

In the future I'd like to become a professional software developer.

As I'm new to programming, I'm still very open about my career. I would like to work for the health care industry. I have also worked as a temp worker (travelling nurse in intensive care) and have many ideas for this business.

Some of my personal interests also offer great opportunities for software, especially astrology and other forms of divination.
