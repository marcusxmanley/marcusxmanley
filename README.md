# Marcus Manley, Berlin

I'm Marcus Manley, currently trying to become a professional programmer.

For questions, comments, or chit-chat write to [marcusxmanley@gmail.com](mailto:marcusxmanley@gmail.com).

## Life before code

Born in 1978, family in Europe and America, grew up in Frankfurt am Main, moved to Berlin in my late 30s, found my wonderful husband and many interesting things in this wonderful and interesting city.

In my previous profession I was an intensive care nurse specialist for two decades.

Currently I work full-time as a spiritual consultant. I won't link my business here as I like to separate my spiritual and technical interests.
