# Marcus Manley

I'm **Marcus Manley** from **Berlin**.

Born in 1978, grew up in Frankfurt am Main, moved to Berlin in my late 30s, found my wonderful husband and many interesting things in this wonderful and interesting city.

## Learning to program

I will start studying coding at [**_42_ Berlin**](https://42berlin.de) in December 2022. The core curriculum will take about a year.

I started coding August 2022, so I'm a total **beginner**.

I am doing the typical _42_ curriculum:

* **C**
* **Unix**

Through building several websites I have rudimentary knowledge of:

* HTML & CSS
* Wordpress

## Things I like

I enjoy using all the new toys I discovered:

* **Vim**
* **Linux**
* **Codewars**

Free software seems like a good idea to me. One of the things I hope to be able to do soon is to contribute to my favorite projects:

* [**Zettlr**](https://www.zettlr.com/)
* [**Neo** keyboard layout](https://neo-layout.org)

## Life before code

In my previous profession I was an **intensive care nurse specialist** for two decades.

Currently I work as a **spiritual consultant**. I won't link my business here as I like to separate my spiritual and technical interests.

## Life after school

In the future I'd like to become a professional software developer.

Software has become one of the foundations of our civilization. It would be a pleasure and an honor to be able to be a part of these efforts.
